# NSE Data collector


Scrape Nairobi Securities Exchange's website for stock price data. Idea is that a cron job would run this on an hourly basis (prices don't move/get updated much on the site). 


## Todo

- [ ] Parse other streams of data (i.e household surveys, company financials, etc).  

- [ ] Front end to view the data 

- [ ] API
